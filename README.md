# budget_manager
The aim of this project is to allow the user to manage and keep track of their earnings, spendings and investments. The budger planner should allow a user to: a) Create, edit and delete spreadsheets via a well built, simple, interactive and a catchy UI. b) Interact with visualisations to see the history of their activities and investments. c) Easily assess the performance of their investments. d) Easily retrieve information from the system. Please note that the dashboard will not be connected to a bank account but will be dependant on the user's input.
